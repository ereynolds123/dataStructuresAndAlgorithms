1) The thing I learned this week was about control
flows. I had never heard the term control flows. I learned
how to use them and wrote a program about one.

2) A question I have is how to use the date and time
in python so you can write programs that interact with time.

3) The hardest part of this week was determining what was meant
by the assignments. I had a hard time knowing what to
write for my control flow. 

4) The easiest part of the week was writing the simple programs

5) I spent about 5 hours on the material for the week.
